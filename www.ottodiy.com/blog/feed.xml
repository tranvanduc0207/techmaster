      <description>&lt;p&gt;Otto builders are the community of Otto DIY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an open map that we created of builds of various #OttoDIY Projects and some of initiatives, companies, maker spaces or learning centers that have made or use Otto in their workshops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/ottobuilders?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG"&gt;#Ottobuilders&lt;/a&gt; are actually around the globe? and How many &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/ottodiy?source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG"&gt;#OttoDIY&lt;/a&gt; has been built? We are about to figure out but we need your help to help us collect all Otto robots and related makers in this map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;Click on the&lt;strong&gt; add marker&lt;/strong&gt; button on the top left (below the search bar) you can click in any place of the world or drop it approximately in your city or just search your address on the top bar to be more precise and then just click in &lt;strong&gt;"add to map"&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; You can input your name (companies also possible to have visibility), choose the color same as your Otto!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Put a short (relevant) description of you Robot build, which project you have done (DIY, PLUS, ARMS or planing other?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Upload a picture and/or video (itÂ´s also possible to add a YouTube link).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; Email or Website, if you wanna be contacted by other builders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this you JOIN OUR INTERNATIONAL NETWORK OF ROBOT MAKERS! for future events, partnership and collaboration.Â Please help us also to hunt places of robot interest!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-size: 160%; text-align: center;"&gt;Are you ready for world domination?ðŸ¤–ðŸ‘¾&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=http://www.ottodiy.com/blog/map&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coding is the lingua franca for all citizen in a modern technological society. By adapting any programming language your kids can learn very important skills, such as abstraction of a problem, defining and structuring a solution and to use a sequence of simple steps to fulfill complex tasks. Beside all the educational benefits of learning to use a programming language it is a lot of fun to see and experience your own programs while performing their autonomous tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important skill within the actual technological society is to understand and control robotic hardware or electronics in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing is more exiting for your kids as if something moves, makes a sound or blinks a lot of lights. Believe me when I say that kids are native robot and automation enthusiasts!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, I was really exited as I read about a vivid community of electronics and programming experts that shared the same idea of building the open educational robotics platform &lt;a href="http://ottodiy.com/"&gt;OttoDIY&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OttoDIY offers all necessary resources, such as electronics, servos, sensors along with 3D printing models of the robotâ€™s body parts to quickly jump into the world of electronics and robotic motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OttoDIY community does share all information that is necessary to quickly print your own Otto robot and assemble the electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the company I work for (kudos to &lt;a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/"&gt;Dynatrace&lt;/a&gt;) strongly supports innovation and coding for kids. Therefore, I had the chance to print our own Otto robot within the Dynatrace lab and I was astonished how easy it is to reproduce the body parts offered on &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/groups/ottodiy/"&gt;thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;. See some impressions of the printing process below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ottoâ€™s brain arrived some weeks later and we immediately started to assemble the complete OttoDIY robot.

      <title>bipedal robots</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Otto it is a robot with legs proposed as an approach to bipedal robots. Otto, still having a very simple mechanical configuration, has the ability to perform many movements such as walking, show emotions or dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, all texts dedicated to bipedal robots begin by praising the advantages that robots with legs can have with respect to robots moved by wheels or other rotating elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I would like to approach the subject from another point of view: the robots with legs are cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are awesome! without giving it more laps, and how cool it is worth breaking your head with impossible mechanical configurations, horrible equations and frustrating results. They are not very grateful robots, their start-up is usually slow (and desolating), and it is rare that they work at the first attempt "&lt;u&gt;like all robots"&lt;/u&gt;. In general, these robots are a challenge for both engineers and fans of robotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on robots with two legs, that is bipeds; we can find countless concepts: from single bipeds with a single engine to humanoids with more than twenty joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good biped robot must be able to modify the position of its mechanical elements, to dynamically move its center of gravity. In fact, this ability will be the most important ingredient when it comes to getting our robot to stand up. A robot in a static position will remain stable if the projection of its center of gravity on the horizontal surface is within the area bounded by the support points of the robot. In summary, for a robot to walk, it is necessary to be able to support its weight on one foot or another, at different moments of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When designing and building bipedal robots, a first option is robots with 2-3 degrees of freedom. If there is a father of this type of robot, that is David Buckley. In 1998 he built the BigFoot, a robot that with only two servos has the ability to move forward, backward and make turns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a...&lt;a href=http://www.ottodiy.com/blog/bipeds&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>how to calibrate your own robot?</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 22:51:40 -0700</pubDate>
      <link>http://www.ottodiy.com/blog/calibration</link>
      <guid>http://www.ottodiy.com/blog/calibration</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post we will cover the whole topic that is driving a lot of uncertain among builders if they are actually assembling in the right way their robots but first what is calibration? As Wikipedia says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;b&gt;Calibration &lt;/b&gt;is the comparison of measurement values delivered by a device under test with those of a calibration standard of known accuracy. Such a standard could be another measurement device of known accuracy, a device generating the quantity to be measured such as a voltage, sound tone, or a physical artefact"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In our case will be "the calibration of the 4 servo motors"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you understand the definition you will find out that you do NOT need to calibrate your Otto to be able to work properly because the calibration is ONLY for precise movements like let's say "straight walk" or standing in one leg without falling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why my OttoÂ legs and feet are twisted?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a very frequent question in our &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ottodiy/"&gt;Otto builder community&lt;/a&gt; and emails, Many Otto builders think they need to calibrate their robot because after assembly they faced this problem, but the true is that, they might skip the important warning in the instruction manual while putting the motors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otto uses 180 degrees servo motors that means the rotation is intentionally limited (we don't want the legs of Otto spinning like freewheels), if you see above picture, the first step is to make sure the servo motor is properly in the middle of the 180 degrees rotation (90 degrees) you don't have to and you won't be that precise at this point (a tolerance of 5 degrees is fine) but is &lt;strong&gt;absolutely necessary&lt;/strong&gt; to put the white servo key in the center otherwise the foot in this case won't turn from side to side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same principle applies to the legs and to Otto PLUS metal gear motors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give a try! and now probably you discover that...&lt;a href=http://www.ottodiy.com/blog/calibration&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Today we have Davor Levstekâ€‹ from Europe here is what he said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in Croatia and work as quality control inspector, testing railway vehicles. My hobbies are electronics, 3D printing and RC toys. This is my first #OttoDIY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My interests in Arduino and 3d printing started with Otto. When I made my first Otto I wanted to make it better, but 3d printing here was too expensive or quality wasnâ€™t satisfying so I decided to make my own 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, I started modifying Otto so I added Bluetooth and modified code so I can use it with Zowi app. In next version I added RGB led for nose, and thanks to Ayunken from youtube I managed to add LED matrix for mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also played with LiPo battery and charger, I have one Otto with it, but Iâ€™m still not satisfied with how it works so Iâ€™m still trying to find best way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I made Otto XL which is 6mm larger than original so I can use 4*AA batteries with led matrix display. That is the last Otto I made and it has following options: custom PCB, BT, RGB led nose,LED matrix, AA batteries, sound sensor and touch sensor for changing modes.Â Otto Minion XL:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also printed one xpider so my Ottos have some company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;" class="s-text-color-custom2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/fy4phGppZ8f0s8Yn1"&gt;Here are more...&lt;a href=http://www.ottodiy.com/blog/davor&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;</description>
